# Screenshot Capture and WebP Optimization

## Goal

Capture visible GitHub Copilot App states for course material:

- Save a **PNG** as the high-quality source artifact.
- Save a **WebP** optimized version for web delivery.
- Keep screenshots deterministic and safe by using a known separate session that is already visible, or by getting explicit approval before changing the visible App window.

## Hidden Session Limitation

macOS screenshot capture requires pixels from a visible display/window. A hidden, background-only, minimized, or API-only Copilot App session cannot be captured with `screencapture` unless the App provides a future render/export API.

For hidden-session tasks:

- Do not call `navigate_to` just to take a screenshot.
- Do not foreground the user's current App window without explicit approval.
- Verify hidden work with `get_session`, session events, and filesystem state.
- Report the limitation plainly when the requested screenshot and hidden execution conflict.

## Required macOS Permissions

Two macOS privacy gates may apply:

- **Accessibility**: required to locate the GitHub Copilot window and read its position/size.
- **Screen Recording**: may be required by `screencapture` to capture app contents.

If a capture is blank, denied, returns `could not create image from display`, or prompts the user, stop and have the user grant permission to the automation caller. Do not bypass macOS privacy controls.

## Local Tool Chain

Observed available tools on this machine:

```text
screencapture=/usr/sbin/screencapture
osascript=/usr/bin/osascript
sips=/usr/bin/sips
cwebp=/opt/homebrew/bin/cwebp
magick=/opt/homebrew/bin/magick
ffmpeg=/opt/homebrew/bin/ffmpeg
pngquant=/opt/homebrew/bin/pngquant
```

Preferred conversion order:

1. `cwebp -q 82 -m 6 -metadata none source.png -o output.webp`
2. `magick source.png -strip -quality 82 output.webp`
3. `ffmpeg -i source.png output.webp`

`sips` is useful for reading dimensions but did not advertise WebP conversion support in the local probe.

## Capture Strategy

Use Accessibility to get the window position and size:

```applescript
tell application "System Events"
  tell process "GitHub Copilot"
    set frontmost to true
    set windowPosition to position of window 1
    set windowSize to size of window 1
  end tell
end tell
```

Then call:

```bash
screencapture -x -R "x,y,width,height" output.png
```

Notes:

- `-x` disables the screenshot sound.
- Rectangle capture is used because Accessibility exposes bounds reliably; exact window id capture would require a lower-level CGWindow lookup.
- On multi-display or Retina setups, validate the first capture. If the crop is offset, capture the full screen once to determine coordinate behavior.

## File Naming

Use descriptive, sortable names:

```text
assets/screenshots/01-first-steps-quick-chat.png
assets/screenshots/01-first-steps-quick-chat.webp
```

For research artifacts:

```text
~/.copilot/session-state/<session>/files/screenshots/<timestamp>-copilot-app.png
~/.copilot/session-state/<session>/files/screenshots/<timestamp>-copilot-app.webp
```

## Recommended Workflow

1. Create a separate session and make it visible only if the user approved visible UI changes.
2. Use app/session APIs or Accessibility to reach the desired UI state.
3. Wait 1-2 seconds for UI to settle.
4. Run `capture-copilot-window.sh`.
5. Inspect file sizes and image dimensions.
6. Review for private data before moving images into course assets.

## Example

```bash
bash .github/skills/github-copilot-app-automation/sample_codes/macos-accessibility/capture-copilot-window.sh \
  assets/screenshots \
  01-first-steps-session-ui
```

This creates:

```text
assets/screenshots/01-first-steps-session-ui.png
assets/screenshots/01-first-steps-session-ui.webp
```

## Recommended: capture by window id (robust)

The Accessibility-rectangle method above can fail on this WebKit-backed app when
`System Events` reports `count of windows = 0` even though a window is visible
(observed on app v1.0.4). The more reliable method captures by CoreGraphics
window id and polls until the window appears:

```bash
bash sample_codes/macos-accessibility/capture-window.sh <chapter>/assets <base-name> 40
```

It uses [find-copilot-window.swift](../sample_codes/macos-accessibility/find-copilot-window.swift)
(CoreGraphics) to locate the window id, then `screencapture -x -l <id>` plus a
WebP encode, and warns if the capture looks blank (a sign Screen Recording is
denied).

## macOS Spaces constraint (important)

CoreGraphics and `screencapture` only see windows on the **currently active
macOS Space**. If the Copilot app is on a different desktop/Space, or on a
display the capture context cannot reach, no window is found and nothing can be
captured — even though the window is "open." Drag the app onto the same desktop
as the terminal running the capture, then retry. `capture-window.sh` polls for
the duration of its timeout, so you can move the window while it waits.

## Use a sanitized training account

Real captures expose live project names, session titles, prompts, diffs, and
possibly tokens. Capture from a sanitized training account connected to the
training fork (with `setup-training-scenarios.sh` run), and review every image
before committing. See [missing-screenshots.md](missing-screenshots.md) for the
full shot list and which states need seeded data.

## Map first

Run [map-app.sh](../sample_codes/macos-accessibility/map-app.sh) to record the
app's actual menus and named controls (version-stamped) before writing capture
steps, and re-run it after an app update to diff exactly what changed.
