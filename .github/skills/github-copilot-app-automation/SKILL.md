# GitHub Copilot App Automation

Use this skill when the task is about **driving, testing, mapping, or experimenting with the GitHub Copilot App**. Prefer app/session APIs first, then app-native canvases/automations, and use GUI Accessibility only when the visible desktop UI itself must be exercised.

## Where to Run This

This skill's power depends heavily on where the agent runs:

| Context | Session/app APIs | Capture reliability | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Inside the GitHub Copilot App agent** (recommended) | Available: `list_projects`, `create_session`, `navigate_to`, `open_issue_session`, `open_pr_session`, plus canvas + workflow APIs | High — `navigate_to` brings the target state to the foreground on the active Space, then `screencapture` grabs it | End-to-end screenshot capture; driving sessions/issues/PRs/canvases/automations to exact states |
| **GitHub Copilot CLI** (terminal) | Not available | Low/manual — a human must navigate the app, and its window must be on the same macOS Space as the terminal | Read-only mapping (`map-app.sh`), the dynamic `screenshots.sh` list/embed flow, and one-off captures of an already-visible window |

For the missing course screenshots, **drive this from inside the app**. The agent can programmatically set up and navigate to each state (the hardest part), and `navigate_to` makes the window visible and capturable, which removes the macOS Spaces/visibility problem the CLI hits. The shell scripts here (`screenshots.sh`, `capture-window.sh`, `map-app.sh`) run in both contexts because the app agent is built on Copilot CLI.

Regardless of context: pixels still come from `screencapture` (there is no pure render/export API yet, so the window must be visible), Screen Recording permission is required, captures must come from a **sanitized training account** on the training fork, and advanced features (Agent Merge, cloud automations) stay policy/billing-gated.

## Non-Interactive / Hidden-Session Rule

If the user asks for a **fresh**, **separate**, or **hidden** Copilot App instance/session:

- Stay on app/session APIs: `list_projects`, `create_session`, `send_session_message`, `get_session`, and filesystem verification.
- Do **not** call `navigate_to`, foreground `open -a`, menu-bar actions, folder pickers, or Accessibility clicks unless the user explicitly asks to see the App UI.
- Do **not** make the user select a folder or project. If a project cannot be registered through available non-interactive surfaces, report that limitation instead of opening a visible picker.
- For local folders, first make the target folder a distinct repo root when needed (`git init` in the target folder) so the App can distinguish it from a parent repository.
- If a hidden registration attempt is necessary, prefer `open -g -j -a "GitHub Copilot" <folder>` and immediately verify with `list_projects`; if it does not register the project, stop and report the gap.
- A screenshot of a hidden/minimized/background-only session is not possible with macOS `screencapture`; screenshot capture requires a visible window or a future App-provided render/export API. Do not switch the user's current App window just to satisfy a hidden screenshot request.

## Operating Model

Work in layers, from safest to most brittle:

1. **Session orchestration tools**: list projects/sessions, create isolated sessions, message sessions, inspect sessions, navigate to sessions.
2. **App-native surfaces**: canvases, automations, project settings, MCP, skills, issue/PR sessions.
3. **Copilot CLI remote control**: useful for CLI sessions via GitHub.com/GitHub Mobile, not for native app GUI control.
4. **macOS Accessibility/UI scripting**: use AppleScript/System Events for named controls such as `Message`, `Select model`, and `Open changes`.
5. **Screenshot capture**: use Accessibility window bounds plus `screencapture` to save PNGs, then convert to WebP for web delivery.
6. **Low-level GUI clicking**: avoid unless the user explicitly approves and no named accessibility control exists.

## Safety Rules

- **Create a separate session for experiments** unless the user explicitly wants the current session modified.
- For hidden/separate-session tasks, **never navigate the user's visible App window** unless explicitly requested.
- **Never submit a prompt, create a PR, merge, delete, approve permissions, or enable Agent Merge** without explicit user intent.
- For GUI probes, start read-only: enumerate windows, controls, roles, names, and actions.
- For composer tests, type a clearly marked draft and clear it without pressing Return/Enter.
- Avoid pixel-coordinate clicks. Target controls by accessibility role/name/action.
- Do not persist secrets or private UI data in repo files. Store scratch probes in `/tmp` or the session artifact directory.
- Screenshots may contain private repo names, prompts, diffs, terminal output, or tokens. Capture only the requested app state and save course-ready images under an intentional assets folder.
- Expect transient app/window states. Re-discover the window and `AXWebArea` before each UI operation.
- If Accessibility is denied, stop and ask the user to grant access to the automation caller. Do not try to bypass macOS privacy controls.
- If `screencapture` fails or returns a privacy prompt, the automation caller also needs macOS Screen Recording permission.

## Known Local App Facts

Observed on this machine:

- App path: `/Applications/GitHub Copilot.app`
- Bundle id: `com.github.githubapp`
- Bundle version observed: `1.0.4` (drifts across releases; re-run `map-app.sh` and re-check after updates)
- Executable: `/Applications/GitHub Copilot.app/Contents/MacOS/github`
- Binary type: native macOS Mach-O arm64
- Frameworks observed include AppKit and WebKit.
- The desktop app is not obviously Electron/Chromium; do not assume Playwright/CDP control is available.

## Known Accessibility Map

After macOS Accessibility permission was enabled, `System Events` could address the app as process `GitHub Copilot`.

Useful exposed controls:

| Control | Role | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `GitHub Copilot` | `AXWindow` | Main app window |
| `GitHub Copilot` | `AXWebArea` | Main webview-backed app content |
| `Sidebar` | `AXGroup` | Sidebar region |
| `Toggle sidebar` | `AXCheckBox` | Collapse/expand sidebar |
| `Create new project or session` | `AXPopUpButton` | New project/session menu |
| `New session in <project>` | `AXButton` | Project-specific new session entry |
| `Message` | `AXTextArea` | Prompt composer |
| `Select model` | `AXComboBox` | Model picker |
| `Conversation timeline` | `AXGroup` | Main conversation history |
| `Open changes` | `AXButton` | Diff/changes surface |

See [macos-accessibility.md](references/macos-accessibility.md) for scripts and caveats.

## Preferred Workflows

### Map the App Safely

1. Confirm the app is running and discover bundle/process state.
2. Enumerate projects and sessions with app/session tools.
3. Run a read-only Accessibility window/menu probe.
4. Enumerate `AXWebArea` children.
5. Save findings to session artifacts, not the repo, unless the user asked for durable docs.

Use:

- [probe-readonly.applescript](sample_codes/macos-accessibility/probe-readonly.applescript)
- [automation-map.md](references/automation-map.md)

### Test Composer Control Without Submitting

1. Create a separate idle session.
2. Navigate to that session.
3. Focus `AXTextArea name=Message`.
4. Set a draft value directly.
5. Read the value back.
6. Clear it with Command+A and Delete.
7. Verify the returned `cleared-value` is empty.

Use [type-and-clear-draft.applescript](sample_codes/macos-accessibility/type-and-clear-draft.applescript).

### Capture Screenshots for Course Assets

Only use this workflow when the user has agreed the App can be visible or when the target state is already visible in a dedicated App window. Capture from a **sanitized training account** on the training fork — never the user's real private projects.

1. Map first with `map-app.sh` so steps match the current app build.
2. Put the Copilot window on the **same macOS Space/desktop** as the terminal running the capture. `screencapture` and CoreGraphics only see the active Space, so a window on another desktop or unreachable display cannot be captured even though it is "open."
3. Navigate the app to the exact state and let spinners settle.
4. Capture by CoreGraphics window id (robust for the WebKit-backed window) and convert to WebP:
   ```bash
   bash sample_codes/macos-accessibility/capture-window.sh <chapter>/assets <base-name> 40
   ```
5. Keep PNG as the source artifact; use WebP in web/course pages.
6. Review screenshots for private data before committing or publishing.

To work through the course's pending shots, discover them dynamically and process one at a time (never hardcode the list): `screenshots.sh list` -> `screenshots.sh next` -> capture -> `screenshots.sh embed`. See [missing-screenshots.md](references/missing-screenshots.md).

Use:

- [screenshot-capture.md](references/screenshot-capture.md) — full method, permissions, and the macOS Spaces constraint
- [missing-screenshots.md](references/missing-screenshots.md) — the generic, one-at-a-time capture workflow (shots are discovered dynamically, never hardcoded)
- [screenshots.sh](sample_codes/macos-accessibility/screenshots.sh) — dynamically `list` / `next` / `embed` the chapters' `<!-- app-screenshot: ... -->` placeholders
- [app-ui-map.md](references/app-ui-map.md) — sanitized factual UI map (menus, sidebar, composer controls), regenerable via map-app.sh
- [capture-window.sh](sample_codes/macos-accessibility/capture-window.sh) — recommended: CoreGraphics window-id capture + WebP; polls until the window appears
- [find-copilot-window.swift](sample_codes/macos-accessibility/find-copilot-window.swift) — lists on-screen Copilot windows and their ids
- [map-app.sh](sample_codes/macos-accessibility/map-app.sh) — version-stamped UI map for grounding steps and diffing app updates
- [capture-copilot-window.sh](sample_codes/macos-accessibility/capture-copilot-window.sh) — older Accessibility-rectangle fallback

### Drive App Work Without GUI Scripting

Prefer session orchestration:

- `list_projects` to find a project id.
- `create_session` to create a new isolated session.
- `send_session_message` to give that session work.
- `get_session` to inspect path and metadata.
- `navigate_to` only when the user explicitly wants to see the session.

See [session-orchestration.md](references/session-orchestration.md).

### Use Canvases for Structured Human-Agent Work

For test boards, dashboards, course trackers, or visible state, use canvas surfaces instead of GUI clicking. Canvases are bidirectional and can expose agent-callable actions. See [canvas-and-automation.md](references/canvas-and-automation.md).

## Decision Table

| Click a named app button | Accessibility by role/name/action |
| Capture a course screenshot | Accessibility window bounds + `screencapture` PNG + WebP conversion |
| Launch recurring experiments | App automations/workflows |
| Build a visible experiment dashboard | Canvas extension |
| Steer a CLI session away from machine | Copilot CLI remote control |
| Test PR/issue lifecycle | App session APIs plus GitHub issue/PR tools |
